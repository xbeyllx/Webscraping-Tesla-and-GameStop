# Webscraping-Tesla-and-GameStop
A coursera project that I complete for the course: "Python Project for Data Science" from IBM.
Tasks included:
- Using requests to grab information from websites.
- Using BeautifulSoup and Pandas to transform html data into Data Frames.
- Creating visuals with Ticker to present that data.
